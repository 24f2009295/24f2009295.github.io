# The Infinite Lottery Paradox: An Interdisciplinary Odyssey

## Abstract
Infinity is one of the most tantalizing ideas in mathematics. It stretches the human imagination, breaks our intuitions, and creates paradoxes that sit at the boundary of logic and philosophy. Among these paradoxes, the *Infinite Lottery Paradox* raises a deceptively simple question: can we imagine a lottery in which each natural number has an equal chance of being chosen? This question bridges mathematics, probability theory, computer science, philosophy, physics, and even cosmology. This project embarks on an interdisciplinary journey into the paradox, weaving together storytelling, rigorous mathematics, and reflections from diverse fields. Along the way, we will see why infinity resists domestication, and why the Infinite Lottery Paradox is not just a quirky puzzle, but a window into the deep structure of reality.
