# The Infinite Lottery Paradox üé≤‚ôæÔ∏è

Welcome to my submission for the **Summer of Math Exposition (SoME4)**!

This article explores one of the most intriguing paradoxes in probability and philosophy:  
the **Infinite Lottery Paradox**.

## What is the Infinite Lottery Paradox?

Imagine a lottery with infinitely many tickets labeled 1, 2, 3, 4, ...  
If every ticket is equally likely, then:

- What is the probability of choosing any *specific* ticket?  
- Can we even define a uniform distribution over infinitely many natural numbers?

## Probability Meets Infinity

Formally, probability requires that the sum of all probabilities = 1.  
But if we assign each natural number the same probability `p`, then:

$$ \infty \cdot p = 1 $$

This implies \( p = 0 \), but then the total sum is 0 ‚Äî a paradox!

## Philosophy and Mathematics

This paradox connects measure theory, set theory, and philosophical debates about infinity.  
I‚Äôll explore ideas like:
- Why standard probability theory breaks down.
- How non-standard analysis and finitely additive measures offer "solutions".
- Why philosophers argue about whether infinite lotteries even make sense.

Stay tuned! This page will grow as I expand the exposition.
